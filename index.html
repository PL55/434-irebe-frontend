Credit: McLendon Photography</p></a>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\">\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>After 30 years of launching companies, there’s one thing Jagdeep Singh (B.S. ’86, computer science and economics) never forgets: there are no guarantees.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I think one thing you need to have is a healthy realization for the fact that you can fail,” Singh explained. “This is not a company job where you have a lot of stability. And that’s what keeps the best entrepreneurs going, because it forces you to not relax, kind of stay on your toes.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case in point, his most recent startup </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.quantumscape.com/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>QuantumScape</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>. Though it could end up being his biggest entrepreneurial success ever, it didn’t always feel like it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“When you’re doing a startup you always have those highs and lows,” Singh said. “There were lots of moments when I’d wake up in the middle of the night and say, ‘Oh my God, this is never going to work.’ And, then there were plenty of times when you see the results and you say, ‘Wow, we’re going to pull this off, it’s amazing, we’re going to change the world.’”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The idea for QuantumScape came unexpectedly 10 years ago, after Singh bought a new sportscar. A Tesla.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It was a two-seater model called the Roadster. It was all electric,” he said. “Driving that around, I began to realize this was the future of cars. It was very fast, and it was clean, no fossil fuel emissions, and really fun to drive. And that’s a great combination.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But the entrepreneur in Singh saw something more—an opportunity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“As I thought about it, I realized it had a lot of limitations with the battery,” he said. “And I got to thinking this is a problem that could be solved—if somebody came up with a breakthrough in batteries, that could really change the game because everything was becoming more and more mobile.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>So, in 2010, Singh left his job as co-founder and CEO of the telecommunications startup Infinera and launched QuantumScape to take on the challenge.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“This a chemistry problem, building a better battery,” Singh explained. “It’s not like software where you can do things more quickly. But the good news is, we were lucky.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Lucky because in just two years, Volkswagen invested in QuantumScape. And in the years that followed, the two companies </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>formed a joint venture, with VW eventually kicking in $200 million more. Additional support came from high-profile investors, including one in particular—Bill Gates—just this year.

Bill’s amazing, he’s wicked smart and he was asking some incredibly deep questions about chemistry. It made me realize this guy is not just a software guy.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Now, 10 years after its launch, QuantumScape has announced an even bigger milestone: it’s about to go </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/quantumscape-ma-kensington/vw-backed-u-s-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-bln-valuation-idUSL1N2FZ1K5\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>public with a $3 billion valuation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The documents are going to be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission,” Singh said. “That’s about a two-month process. Once they approve it, there’s going to be a shareholder vote and then it’s official—the ticker symbol changes to QS and we’re now publicly traded.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>An “overnight success” in 10 years. Years that Singh spent building relationships and managing the uncertainty.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“In some ways you can think of my job as CEO as the chief risk officer,” Singh said. “My job is to worry about all the risks and all the things that can go wrong. And make sure I get someone on the team who is more of an expert in each of those areas than I am. And until someone else is worrying about the problem more than I do, I can’t stop worrying about it.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>And there are still more challenges ahead.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“This public offering is in some ways the beginning of a journey,” Singh explained. “We have a lot more work ahead of us to get these batteries to customers to build cars. Right now, for the next many years, that’s going to be my exclusive focus, to take this from the lab to actually put it out there in cars on the road.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span><span>Inspired to Innovate</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Even as a kid, Singh knew he wanted to innovate, create and even be an entrepreneur.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I remember seeing an issue of </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Time</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> magazine with Steve Jobs on the cover when I was around 15 years old and I remember thinking that was something that would be very cool to do,” he said. “Since then I’ve always been looking for ways to do something.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Singh entered the University of Maryland as a freshman when he was just 15 years old. He loved science and was especially drawn to computers. Four years later, he graduated with a degree in computer science and economics and headed to Silicon Valley.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I spent the first few years working at different companies like Hewlett Packard and Sun Microsystems,” he said. “Then I enrolled in a graduate computer science program at Stanford and midway through I took a leave of absence to start my first company.” </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Singh was in his mid-20s. That first startup was Airsoft, a software company for wireless networks. A few years later, Singh sold it, went back and finished up his master’s degree, then joined a venture capital firm briefly before launching his next startup. He quickly realized that Silicon Valley was exactly where he needed to be.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“When I got here, I realized the whole economy here is based on startups. You’re not considered an outlier, it’s what people do here. They start companies,” he explained. “It’s kind of like being in Hollywood. You can make a movie anywhere but if you’re in Hollywood, you have a whole infrastructure there—directors, actors, money and so on. An entrepreneur is kind of like a producer. You’re the person who brings all the pieces together.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>And Singh did, launching companies including optical communications carrier OnFiber; optical switch startup Lightera; Infinera, a company he took public in an initial public offering valued over $1 billion; and most recently, QuantumScape.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It’s been a fun ride,” he said. “Here in Silicon Valley, if you can identify a problem, and you can think of ways to solve it and solve it in a way that resonates with enough customers then you can really make a big impact.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Through it all, Singh has maintained a close relationship with UMD, coming back to campus as a College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences (CMNS) </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/35k22-F1ZEk?t=567\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>commencement speaker</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, serving as a member of the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://cmns.umd.edu/about-cmns/board-visitors\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CMNS Board of Visitors</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, and especially keeping close ties to the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://cs.umd.edu/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Department of Computer Science</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span> “I’m on the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/community/computer-science-advisory-board\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Computer Science Advisory Board</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> and that’s been a fun thing to do because I graduated from the department,” he said. “That’s what set me on the path that I’m on and I felt like I was pretty well prepared for life based on that.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A philanthropic gift from Singh funded a </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4404\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>makerspace</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> in the new Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering where students can innovate and create. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It feels good to help a little bit,” he explained. “These hacker-makerspaces are a cool concept because students take classes but the students who really want to start companies need a place where they can actually try stuff out.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Now, with one of his three daughters in her senior year at UMD majoring in </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://bsci.umd.edu/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>biological sciences</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, Singh sees his own experiences reflected in her stories from campus.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It’s funny because a lot of what she does is familiar, some of the details have changed, but the class numbers are still the same. So when she talks about the classes, the general requirements and so on, it brings back memories,” Singh said. “I kind of feel like I know what she’s talking about. So, in that sense it’s been very cool.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whatever he’s doing, whether it’s in his personal or professional life, it’s important to Singh to keep growing, to keep doing more, sometimes even upside down. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I feel like all growth happens when you are outside your comfort zone, so I find myself picking up new activities that require skill and time to get better at,” he explained. “A few years ago, I took up handstands, balancing on your hands, and not having a gymnastics background it was crazy hard at first. Now I’m able to do freestanding handstands, which has been a great. Trying new things, that’s when your new synaptic connections form in your brain.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As an entrepreneur, learning new things comes with the territory. And even now, as Singh watches QuantumScape soar to new heights, his search for the next big thing never stops.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I run a little new venture incubator,” he explained. “What we do is exactly what I’ve been doing for years, look for problems that have science-based solutions. We try to test out hypotheses and then spin off a company. Those things force you to learn new areas and that’s what I do for fun.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>After 30 years, Singh is still innovating and creating, still with no guarantees. And enjoying the journey every step of the way.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It’s funny because you can’t really have a master plan for your life,” he said. “You can have a general direction that you want to go, you can say you want to start companies, but you can’t really predict the outcome. You just take it one step at a time and see where it leads. But I gotta say, it’s been a lot of fun.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><em><span><span><span><span><span><span>Written by Leslie Miller</span></span></span></span></span></span></em></p>\n</div></div></div>\n",

And that’s what keeps the best entrepreneurs going, because it forces you to not relax, kind of stay on your toes.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case in point, his most recent startup </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.quantumscape.com/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>QuantumScape</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>. Though it could end up being his biggest entrepreneurial success ever, it didn’t always feel like it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“When you’re doing a startup you always have those highs and lows,” Singh said. “There were lots of moments when I’d wake up in the middle of the night and say, ‘Oh my God, this is never going to work.’ And, then there were plenty of times when you see the results and you say, ‘Wow, we’re going to pull this off, it’s amazing, we’re going to change the world.’”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The idea for QuantumScape came unexpectedly 10 years ago, after Singh bought a new sportscar. A Tesla.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It was a two-seater model called the Roadster. It was all electric,” he said. “Driving that around, I began to realize this was the future of cars. It was very fast, and it was clean, no fossil fuel emissions, and really fun to drive. And that’s a great combination.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But the entrepreneur in Singh saw something more—an opportunity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“As I thought about it, I realized it had a lot of limitations with the battery,” he said. “And I got to thinking this is a problem that could be solved—if somebody came up with a breakthrough in batteries, that could really change the game because everything was becoming more and more mobile.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>So, in 2010, Singh left his job as co-founder and CEO of the telecommunications startup Infinera and launched QuantumScape to take on the challenge.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“This a chemistry problem, building a better battery,” Singh explained. “It’s not like software where you can do things more quickly. But the good news is, we were lucky.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Lucky because in just two years, Volkswagen invested in QuantumScape. And in the years that followed, the two companies </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>formed a joint venture, with VW eventually kicking in $200 million more. Additional support came from high-profile investors, including one in particular—Bill Gates—just this year. In his online blog </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>GatesNotes, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gates called QuantumScape “a manufacturer working to commercialize the next generation of battery technology,” and predicted that better and cheaper batteries “will hopefully make [electric vehicles] a realistic option for every car owner.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I met Bill Gates through one of our investors,” Singh recalled. “I thought he’d be a software guy, but he turned out to be incredibly knowledgeable in almost any field.

But during her freshman year at the University of Maryland, the computer science major stepped into Reckord Armory and was suddenly surrounded by a sea of more than 800 girls, women and nonbinary computer and technology enthusiasts. She had found Technica, UMD’s student-run hackathon. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It was empowering to see that sort of representation,” said Aggarwal, a senior who also participates in the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/fellows/quest\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>QUEST Honors Program</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> and is pursuing a minor in general business. “It was just so inspiring to see so many female and non-binary people in one space focusing on technology and uplifting each other.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>That was 2017. It was Aggarwal’s first experience with </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://gotechnica.org/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Technica</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, the largest all-women and nonbinary hackathon in the world. Although Aggarwal had been interested in technology since learning to program Lego robots in middle school, she had never attended a hackathon. During Technica, she and a team of friends developed an online game in which users answer questions to navigate a series of obstacles to help a girl in the developing world get to school. Their </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/cycles-for-her-future\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>project</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> won Bloomberg’s best education diversity and inclusion hack at the event. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The project supported Technica’s message of female empowerment and aligned with a cause close to Aggarwal’s heart. The game she and her team developed was inspired by the mission of Girl Up, a United Nations Foundation campaign to advance adolescent girls’ skills, rights and opportunities to become leaders. Aggarwal was actively involved with Girl Up in high school and made it her mission to help the UMD chapter grow when she arrived on campus. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Girl Up's messages of empowerment, gender equality and education are really important to me,” Aggarwal said. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Even after attending Technica, she hesitated to go to other hackathons—most of which are dominated by males—but the young women she met at Technica gave her the boost she needed. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The idea of going to another hackathon was still intimidating, because it’s unfamiliar territory,” she recalled. “But Technica is such a supportive community, one of the organizers I met encouraged me to go to other hackathons, and it turned out to be really fun.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Aggarwal next went to HackRU at Rutgers University, where her team won best sci-fi hack,</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> JPMorgan Chase’s </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>best social good hack and Capital One’s best financial hack. They created ALFEKA, a plush alpaca modified with an Arduino, servos and LED lights to interact with children and teach them financial literacy by making it fun to deposit money, create goals and check their balance. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“HackRU was a great weekend,” Aggarwal said. “I learned so much, and we even brought our alpaca back to Technica 2018 to showcase it as a fun project.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>By then, Aggarwal had been drawn into the Technica community and volunteered to serve on the sponsorship team. She loved being part of an organization that created a space where girls and non-binary individuals saw that they belonged in technology and could explore their passions. During her sophomore and junior years, she and the Technica sponsorship team secured the support of donors for the event and managed a budget of $230,000. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Now, as a senior, Aggarwal serves as the co-executive director of this year’s event, which will be held on October 24-25, 2020. Because COVID-19 turned this year’s event into a virtual hackathon, she and her team had to reinvent many of the program’s offerings.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“We worked really hard to recreate the magic of Technica,” she said. “We’re having a lot of the quintessential things about a hackathon like the sponsorship fair, meetings with mentors, watercooler chats where hackers can interchange ideas, and all of the workshops. All of those things will still be part of Technica this year, they’ll just look a little different.” </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Aggarwal also hinted that there will be some special, platform-specific offerings to help keep participants engaged. She was quick to point out that one silver lining to an all-virtual hackathon is that participation will not be restricted to participants from the nearby region this year. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Now you can be anywhere in the U.S. or Canada and come to Technica,” she said. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>And the online format hasn’t seemed to hinder the enthusiasm of participants who have registered in record-high numbers. More than 1,000 people have signed up to attend. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Aggarwal’s positivity and ability to find the silver lining have helped her adjust to a year turned upside down by COVID-19. When the pandemic forced her summer internship at Microsoft to morph from an in-person experience in Redmond, Washington, to a virtual job from her parents’ home in Ellicott City, Maryland, she discovered the benefits of networking online. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“While you may meet fewer people in a virtual internship, the connections you make are more well-thought-out and they last a little bit longer,” she mused. “And you have a very clear and easy way to follow up with them.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As she contemplates life after college, Aggarwal wants to start her career in a corporate setting at a large technology company. And her experiences at UMD have exposed her to a variety of areas in computer science. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Aggarwal participated in the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.fire.umd.edu/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>First-Year Innovation and Research Experience</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> (FIRE) Program where she learned to use the programing language R to develop a machine learning model for groundwater extraction rates in the Midwest and presented her research at the American Geophysical Union’s </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Person/767743\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>fall meeting</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>.

So, rather than training the system to identify fraud, Feizi is developing a method that asks the machine to identify \"normal.\" Then, the system can flag anything that doesn’t fit in. This approach, called \"unsupervised learning,\" lets the machine learn how to find anomalies without being told what anomalies look like.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>\"The unsupervised model aims to characterize the underlying distribution of the normal data. Learning this distribution aids us in flagging anomalies,\" explained Feizi, who is also a core faculty member of the Center for Machine Learning.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Feizi’s method has proven effective on publicly available data. Now, he is working with Capital One to incorporate the company’s proprietary data and eventually deploy the method live on Capital One’s system to prevent fraudulent transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The close partnership between Professor Feizi's team and our applied researchers ensures that the research breakthroughs made at the University of Maryland are quickly adopted by Capital One,” said Bayan Bruss, Director, Applied Research Lead, Center for Machine Learning, Capital One. “At the same time, we are able to provide input on where there is still room for improvement on real world datasets and problems, thereby opening up new lines of inquiry for university researchers.\"</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Working with Capital One has been convenient for Feizi and other faculty members in the Center for Machine Learning, which is housed in UMD’s new </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://iribe.umd.edu/\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>.

      "Question":"Are admissions competitive?",
      "Answer":"We try our best to accommodate/admit all eligible students who apply; however, in the event that the program does become competitive at a future date, we encourage applicants to gain some research experience and submit the strongest application package possible."
   },
   {
      "Question":"Do recommenders need to be CS faculty?",
      "Answer":"It\u2019s highly recommended that at least one recommender is a tenured CS professor; however, feel free to submit letters of recommendation from other departments or internships. Letter writers should have at least a Masters and be able to speak to your ability to do well in the program."
   },
   {
      "Question":"How long does the program take?",
      "Answer":"The MS program is 30 credits. Flagging 3 courses (9 credits) for double-counting only reduces the program length by one semester. Taking an additional course that is flagged just for graduate credit is necessary to make a one year MS feasible, as it reduces the remaining time (30 credits - 12 credits = 18) to two semesters of taking 3 courses per semester."
   },
   {
      "Question":"How many letters of recommendation are needed?",
      "Answer":"Three letters of recommendation are required. It is recommended that at least two are from CS faculty with at least one of those being from a tenure-track faculty member"
   },
   {
      "Question":"I am not involved in research. Should I still apply?",
